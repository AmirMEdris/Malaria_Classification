## Project Overview
Malaria is silently a large killer to this day. In fact, every year there are over 200 million cases with about 400,000 deaths.
Malaria is caused through parasites transmitted through mosquito bites. Thus, Parasite counts are used to diagnose malaria  correctly. However, the manual counting of parasites varies depending on the skill and expertise of the microscopist. Depending on the conditions and treament of these scientisits, accurate diagnosis can vary. Thus, the goal of this project is to create a highly accurate image classification model that can quickly and effictively diagnose Malaria.
